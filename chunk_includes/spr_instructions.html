      Dear Participant,<br /> Thank you for choosing to continue with the
      experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this task, you will read sentences in English. These will be displayed
      to you word by word. First, a cross mark (X) will appear in the middle of
      the monitor. To start reading the sentence, press the <em>SPACE BAR</em>.
      Before beginning the next sentence, you will have to press the
      <em>ENTER</em> key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the sentences at your own normal reading speed so that you understand
      the content. Please keep one finger on the <em>SPACE BAR</em> while
      reading. Always press the <em>SPACE BAR</em> to see the next word. Please
      note that you cannot go back to the previous word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sentences are followed by the comprehension question that refer
      exclusively to the sentence that you just read. These will be simple
      yes/no questions. Please press <em>D</em> key for "yes" and <em>K</em> key
      for "no". After you have answered, the question will disapper. However,
      there is no minimum time to answer the question.
    </p>
