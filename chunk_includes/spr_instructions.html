      Dear Participant,<br /> Thank you for choosing to continue with the
      experiment.
    </p>
    <p>Your task in this experiment is to read sentences. 
    These will be shown to you piece by piece. 
    First, you must press <em>ENTER</em> to start reading the sentence. 

    At first, you'll see dashes representing the length of the sentence:</p>
    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;"><tt>___ ___ ____ __ ___ ____</tt></p></div>

    <p>To read the first part of the sentence, press the <em>SPACEBAR</em>:</p>

    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;"><tt>Alex ___ ____ ____ ___ ____</tt></p></div>

    <p>As soon as you press the <em>SPACEBAR</em> again, the next sentence part will appear, and the previous part will disappear.
    This will continue until you reach the end of the sentence. 
    After reading the last part of the sentence, press the <em>SPACEBAR</em> to continue.</p>
    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;">
        <tt>___ can ____ ____ ___ ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ deal ____ ___ ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ ____ with ___ ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ ____ ____ any ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ ____ ____ ___ man</tt></p></div>

    <p>Read the sentences at your usual speed and make sure you understand the meaning.
    Please always keep one finger on the <em>SPACEBAR</em> while reading.</p>
    <p>
      Some sentences are followed by the comprehension question that refer
      exclusively to the sentence that you just read. These will be simple
      yes/no questions. Please press <em>D</em> key for "yes" and <em>K</em> key
      for "no". After you have answered, the question will disapper. However,
      there is no minimum time to answer the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have a few practice trials to get familiar with the task. After
      the completion of practice trials, the actual experiment will begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This task will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. If you have any
      queries or concerns regarding the task, please contact
