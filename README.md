# Self-Paced-Reading
A repository containing the SPR implementation using PCIbex with a custom setup to show instructions, practice trials with feedback to comprehension questions, and the main SPR task. Additionally, an approach is included to redirect the participants to desired websites. This is beneficial if you need to redirect your participants to Prolific for successful completion and payment, or redirect them to a next experiment link if SPR is a single part of your setup.

#### Note:
Modify the global_z.css file for any local modification of your HTML div or class implementations.

The following sites were referred to implement this design:
- https://doc.pcibex.net
- https://chuprinko-kirill.github.io/pcibex_tutorial/sprt.html
- https://pryslopska.com/projects/lab_crab/pcibex/questionnaire/
- https://www.pcibex.net/forums/topic/click-button-and-file-attachment/ (and some other forum questions which Jeremy has generously answered)

The implementation can be cloned and used for your projects!
